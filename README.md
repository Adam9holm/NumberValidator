# Interview Task

This repository contains a coding [assignment](./assignment.md) used as part of Omegapoint's recruitment process and an [extension assignment](./extension_assignment.md) for experienced candidates.

## Getting Started

You may do the [assignment](./assignment.md) in the programming languages requested by the recruitment contact. If no language was agreed upon, please choose the language you have the most experience with that is outlined in the technical requirements in the [assignment](./assignment.md) to complete the task.

For experienced candidates, if requested by the recruitment contact, once the initial assignment is done, there is an [extension assignment](./extension_assignment.md) required to be compleated for further skill assessment.

A quick way to get started is by using GitHub Codespaces, a development environment configured with the basic SDK and runtimes required for most languages in a Visual Studio Code editor.

For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).

If you prefer to use a JetBrains IDE, follow the [setup instructions for using GitHub Codespaces in JetBrains IDE](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide).

Using a Codespace is NOT a requirement for the assignment, just an optional IDE and development environment.
